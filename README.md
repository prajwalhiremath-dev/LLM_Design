# LLM from Scratch — Hands-On Curriculum (PyTorch)


## Part 0 — Foundations & Mindset
- **0.1** Understanding the high-level LLM training pipeline (pretraining → finetuning → alignment)
- **0.2** Hardware & software environment setup (PyTorch, CUDA/Mac, mixed precision, profiling tools)

```
conda create -n llm_from_scratch python=3.11
conda activate llm_from_scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Part 1 — Core Transformer Architecture
- **1.1** Positional embeddings (absolute learned vs. sinusoidal)
- **1.2** Self-attention from first principles (manual computation with a tiny example)
- **1.3** Building a *single attention head* in PyTorch
- **1.4** Multi-head attention (splitting, concatenation, projections)
- **1.5** Feed-forward networks (MLP layers) — GELU, dimensionality expansion
- **1.5** Residual connections & **LayerNorm**
- **1.6** Stacking into a full Transformer block

## Part 2 — Training a Tiny LLM
- **2.1** Byte-level tokenization
- **2.2** Dataset batching & shifting for next-token prediction
- **2.3** Cross-entropy loss & label shifting
- **2.4** Training loop from scratch (no Trainer API)
- **2.5** Sampling: temperature, top-k, top-p
- **2.6** Evaluating loss on val set

## Part 3 — Modernizing the Architecture
- **3.1** **RMSNorm** (replace LayerNorm, compare gradients & convergence)
- **3.2** **RoPE** (Rotary Positional Embeddings) — theory & code
- **3.3** SwiGLU activations in MLP
- **3.4** KV cache for faster inference
- **3.5** Sliding-window attention & **attention sink**
- **3.6** Rolling buffer KV cache for streaming

## Part 4 — Scaling Up
- **4.1** Switching from byte-level to BPE tokenization
- **4.2** Gradient accumulation & mixed precision
- **4.3** Learning rate schedules & warmup
- **4.4** Checkpointing & resuming
- **4.5** Logging & visualization (TensorBoard / wandb)

## Part 5 — Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
- **5.1** MoE theory: expert routing, gating networks, and load balancing
- **5.2** Implementing MoE layers in PyTorch
- **5.3** Combining MoE with dense layers for hybrid architectures

## Part 6 — Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- **6.1** Instruction dataset formatting (prompt + response)
- **6.2** Causal LM loss with masked labels
- **6.3** Curriculum learning for instruction data
- **6.4** Evaluating outputs against gold responses

## Part 7 — Reward Modeling
- **7.1** Preference datasets (pairwise rankings)
- **7.2** Reward model architecture (transformer encoder)
- **7.3** Loss functions: Bradley–Terry, margin ranking loss
- **7.4** Sanity checks for reward shaping

## Part 8 — RLHF with PPO
- **8.1** Policy network: our base LM (from SFT) with a value head for reward prediction.
- **8.2** Reward signal: provided by the reward model trained in Part 7.
- **8.3** PPO objective: balance between maximizing reward and staying close to the SFT policy (KL penalty).
- **8.4** Training loop: sample prompts → generate completions → score with reward model → optimize policy via PPO.
- **8.5** Logging & stability tricks: reward normalization, KL-controlled rollout length, gradient clipping.

## Part 9 — RLHF with GRPO
- **9.1** Group-relative baseline: instead of a value head, multiple completions are sampled per prompt and their rewards are normalized against the group mean.
- **9.2** Advantage calculation: each completion’s advantage = (reward – group mean reward), broadcast to all tokens in that trajectory.
- **9.3** Objective: PPO-style clipped policy loss, but *policy-only* (no value loss).
- **9.4** KL regularization: explicit KL(π‖π_ref) penalty term added directly to the loss (not folded into the advantage).
- **9.5** Training loop differences: sample `k` completions per prompt → compute rewards → subtract per-prompt mean → apply GRPO loss with KL penalty.
